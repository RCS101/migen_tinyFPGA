Design Errors/Warnings
----------------------

WARNING - map: C:/cygwin64/home/robin/Documents/migen_tinyFPGA/Blinky/Blinky_Lat
     tice/blinky/template_a2.lpf(8): Semantic error in "IOBUF PORT "user_mosi"
     IO_TYPE=LVCMOS33 ;": Port "user_mosi" does not exist in the design. This
     preference has been disabled.
WARNING - map: input pad net 'user_mosi' has no legal load.
WARNING - map: OSCH 'OSCH' has FREQUENCY preference value set to 16.43 MHZ,
     which is different from the actual value 15.65 MHZ. The FREQUENCY
     preference is still within the 5.5% tolerence of the actual value.
WARNING - map: IO buffer missing for top level port user_mosi...logic will be
     discarded.
